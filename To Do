I have four profiles. In preferences I have set for two profiles the return address to "My card" and for the other two profiles a have set it to a group (with only one address in it). Switching from a profile that uses my card for the return address to a profile that uses the group for the return address will change the return address as expected. However, changing from a profile hat uses the group for the return address to a profile that uses my card for the return address, never changes the return address. I need to open the preferences window (where the choice is correctly shown in the popup menu) and click "Okay" to have the return address change.
