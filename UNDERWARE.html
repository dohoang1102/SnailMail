("User Now Defines Entity Rights" software licensing)</h2></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The UNDER-Ware software license agreement is designed to be one of the
most user-friendly software licenses ever.&nbsp; The driving principle
behind this license agreement is that the USER gets to choose at least
some aspects of the license UNDER which they install, use and distribute
the licensed entity from a list of options included with the license (see blow)
itself.&nbsp; Some people are not comfortable with "One size fits all" products, hence the UNDER-ware
motto is:
<blockquote><b>Your UNDER-Ware should be comfortable.</b></blockquote>
Note that which ever software license options the software is used UNDER,
there are some additional license requirements that the software is bound
by:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The software must not be distributed without the complete package including
the license agreement, documentation, etc.</li>

<li>
The software must not be used for any commercial purposes without the written
permission of the author.</li>

<li>
The software remains the copyright property of the author.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h2>
UNDER-Ware License Options</h2></center>
Here is a list of options from which the UNDER-Ware license holder may
choose:
<ul>
<li>
Shareware - if you like the product and wish to keep using it, please send
some money to the author(s) as they've put a lot of effort into it, and
like to know that it's been appreciated.&nbsp; Whatever you think is a
fair amount will do.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Beerware - similar to shareware, but instead of money, send some of your
local brew (surface mail only - beer doesn't much like the lack of air-pressure
at high altitudes).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Haggleware - Don't like any of the other options?&nbsp; Got some other
way to show your appreciation?&nbsp; Let the developer(s) know.&nbsp; They
may be happy to accept other options you come up with.</li>
</ul>
